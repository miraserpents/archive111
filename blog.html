                    my teacher got mad at me :( she found out i haven't done our mythology test!! ITS NOT EVEN AN ENGLISH SUBJECT. english is one of my best swubjects, i'm insanely good at writing. its entirely my teacher fault that im aolmost failing dude. she rigged the grading, hers is harder than the OFFICIAL school board system. mind you we're in 9th grade, ITS NOT THAT SERIOUS </p>

                <p>
                    my momma thought i was depressed because i sobbed for 2 hours yesterday BECAUSE OF ENGLISH STRESS. i told her im doing well in all other classes, except for english because of my teacher. she said she isn't going to get mad because she understands my teacher is insane. i'm pretty sure it was also because she sa2w how much it affected me, i mean hell i literally cried for 2 hours, that's a fire mentality</p>
